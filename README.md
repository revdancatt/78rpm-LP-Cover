## About

This was an air drop for owners of 78rpm (https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/12638), snapshot taken around lunch time (UK) Monday the 23rd October 2023.

These made use of the new fxhash iteration feature, allowing me to have the correct labels viewable through the hole in the sleeve.

Completing the airdrop of covers for 33.333rpm, 45rpm and now 78rpm from MNML SER I. A nice protective cover to stop the vinyl getting scratched, nice, simple and clean.
